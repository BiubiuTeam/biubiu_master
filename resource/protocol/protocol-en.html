        Rules and Regulations.<br/>
        1.  Do not post content that is offensive, libelous, defamatory, indecent, harmful, harassing, intimidating, threatening, hateful, abusive, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, or offensive in a sexual, racial, cultural, or ethnic context. <br/>

        2. Do not post any commercial messages or comments. <br/>

        3. Generally you can assume that anything you find online is copyrighted. We prefer you post a synopsis in your own words and the link to the article. <br/>

        4. Do not post any content that involves the transmission of "junk mail," "chain letters," or unsolicited mass mailing or "spamming." Do not defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others. Let others have their say, just as you may. <br/>

        Changes.<br/>
        biubiu may change, update, or add or remove provisions of these Terms, at any time by posting the updated Terms on the Services or by notifying you via the App. By using the Services after biubiu has updated the Terms, you are agreeing to all the updated Terms; if you do not agree with any of the updated Terms, you must stop using Services.<br/>

        </p>
        <p class="content">
        General use.<br/>
        biubiu provides content through the Services that is copyrighted and/or trademarked work of biubiu or biubiu's third-party licensors and suppliers or other users of the Services (collectively, the ''Materials''). Materials may include logos, graphics, video, images, software and other content.<br/><br/>

        The following additional terms and conditions apply with respect to any Mobile Application that biubiu provides to you designed for use on an Apple iOS-powered mobile device (an ''iOS App''):<br/><br/>

        You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and biubiu only, and not with Apple, Inc. (''Apple'').<br/><br/>
        Your use of biubiu's iOS App must comply with Apple's then-current App Store Terms of Service.<br/><br/>
        biubiu, and not Apple, are solely responsible for our iOS App and the Services and Content available thereon. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance and support services with respect to our iOS App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to our iOS App.<br/><br/>
        You agree that biubiu, and not Apple, are responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third-party relating to our iOS App or your possession and/or use of our iOS App.<br/><br/>
        You agree that biubiu, and not Apple, shall be responsible, to the extent required by these Terms, for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party intellectual property infringement claim related to our iOS App or your possession and use of our iOS App.<br/><br/>
        You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ''terrorist supporting'' country; and (ii) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.<br/><br/>
        You agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using our iOS App (e.g., you must not be in violation of your wireless data service terms of agreement when using the iOS App).<br/><br/>
        The parties agree that Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to these Terms as they relate to your license of biubiu's iOS App. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as they relate to your license of the iOS App as a third-party beneficiary thereof.<br/><br/>

        </p>
        <p class="content">
        Submissions.<br/>

        You are responsible for any information, opinions, messages, comments, photos, videos, graphics, sounds and other content or material that you submit, upload, post or otherwise make available on or through the Services (each a ''Submission'') and through the Services available in connection with the Services. We reserve the right to retain your Submissions, even after they have expired from view within the App or even after you have deleted them. However, you agree that we have no obligation to retain any Submission for any period of time, nor shall we be responsible or liable to you or any third party for any lost content or losses related to the expiration or deletion of a Submission.
